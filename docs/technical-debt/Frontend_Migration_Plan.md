# Frontend Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to migrate our existing frontend applications to a more modern, maintainable, and secure architecture. The migration addresses several technical debt issues while improving developer experience and application performance.

## Current State

Our frontend applications (`web/ai-chat` and `web/todo-app`) currently have the following characteristics:

- Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite
- Direct communication with internal services
- Inconsistent component organization
- Varying levels of test coverage
- Security concerns with direct API access
- Limited performance optimization

## Target State

After migration, our frontend applications will have:

- Consistent architecture across all applications
- Secure communication through co-located BFF pattern
- Improved component organization and reusability
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Enhanced performance and accessibility
- Better developer experience

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Architecture Standardization (4 weeks)

#### 1.1 Implement Co-located BFF Pattern

Implement a co-located Deno BFF server for each web application to secure internal service access:

```diff
  web/app-name/
  ├── src/                # Frontend code
  ├── dist/               # Build output
+ ├── server.ts           # NEW co-located Deno BFF server
  ├── deno.json
  └── vite.config.ts
```

The BFF server will:
- Handle API requests and proxy them to internal services
- Add authentication to service requests
- Serve the static frontend assets
- Implement proper error handling and logging

#### 1.2 Update Network Configuration

- Create Docker network isolation for internal services
- Configure reverse proxy for web applications
- Remove direct exposure of internal services

#### 1.3 Refactor API Clients

- Update all API clients to use the co-located BFF endpoints
- Remove direct references to internal service URLs
- Implement consistent error handling

**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 3 weeks  
**Risk**: Medium (potential service disruption)  
**Dependencies**: None

### Phase 2: Component Library Development (6 weeks)

#### 2.1 Audit Existing Components

- Identify common components across applications
- Document component APIs and usage patterns
- Assess reusability potential

#### 2.2 Create Shared Component Library

- Develop a shared component library package
- Implement core UI components (buttons, forms, cards, etc.)
- Add comprehensive documentation and examples

#### 2.3 Migrate Applications to Use Shared Components

- Replace application-specific components with shared ones
- Update styling to use consistent design tokens
- Ensure backward compatibility

**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: 6 weeks  
**Risk**: Low (can be done incrementally)  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization (3 weeks)

#### 3.1 Implement Code Splitting

- Add route-based code splitting
- Lazy load non-critical components
- Optimize bundle size

#### 3.2 Add Performance Monitoring

- Implement Core Web Vitals tracking
- Set up performance budgets
- Create performance dashboards

#### 3.3 Optimize Asset Loading

- Implement image optimization
- Add resource hints (preload, prefetch)
- Optimize font loading

**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: 3 weeks  
**Risk**: Low  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1

### Phase 4: Testing Enhancement (4 weeks)

#### 4.1 Standardize Test Structure

- Ensure consistent test organization across applications
- Implement shared test utilities
- Add test documentation

#### 4.2 Increase Test Coverage

- Add missing unit tests for components
- Implement integration tests for key flows
- Add E2E tests for critical user journeys

#### 4.3 Set Up Continuous Testing

- Configure automated test runs in CI
- Implement test coverage reporting
- Add visual regression testing

**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: 4 weeks  
**Risk**: Low  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1, 2

### Phase 5: Accessibility Improvements (3 weeks)

#### 5.1 Conduct Accessibility Audit

- Run automated accessibility checks
- Perform manual testing with screen readers
- Document accessibility issues

#### 5.2 Implement Accessibility Fixes

- Fix keyboard navigation issues
- Add proper ARIA attributes
- Improve color contrast
- Enhance screen reader support

#### 5.3 Add Accessibility Testing

- Implement automated accessibility tests
- Add accessibility checks to CI pipeline
- Create accessibility documentation

**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: 3 weeks  
**Risk**: Low  
**Dependencies**: Phase 2

## Implementation Details

### Co-located BFF Implementation

Each web application will have a `server.ts` file that implements the BFF pattern:

```typescript
// web/app-name/server.ts
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { serveStatic } from '@hono/node-server/serve-static';
import { serve } from '@hono/node-server';

// Configuration
const INTERNAL_SERVICE_URL = Deno.env.get("INTERNAL_SERVICE_URL");
const INTERNAL_API_KEY = Deno.env.get("INTERNAL_API_KEY");
const PORT = parseInt(Deno.env.get("PORT") || "3000", 10);

const app = new Hono();

// API routes
const api = app.basePath('/api');

api.post('/endpoint', async (c) => {
  // Validate request
  const body = await c.req.json();
  
  // Forward to internal service with authentication
  const response = await fetch(`${INTERNAL_SERVICE_URL}/endpoint`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "X-Internal-API-Key": INTERNAL_API_KEY!,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(body),
  });

  return new Response(response.body, { status: response.status });
});

// Static file serving
app.use('*', serveStatic({ root: './dist' }));
app.get('*', serveStatic({ path: './dist/index.html' }));

// Start server
console.log(`Server starting on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
serve({
  fetch: app.fetch,
  port: PORT,
});
```

### Shared Component Library Structure

The shared component library will be organized as follows:

```
packages/ui/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Button/
│   │   │   ├── Button.tsx
│   │   │   ├── Button.css
│   │   │   └── Button.test.tsx
│   │   ├── Card/
│   │   ├── Form/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── hooks/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── index.ts
├── docs/
│   ├── components/
│   └── examples/
├── deno.json
└── README.md
```

## Migration Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Service disruption during BFF implementation | High | Medium | Implement in staging first, comprehensive testing, rollback plan |
| Component library breaking changes | Medium | Medium | Version properly, maintain backward compatibility, thorough testing |
| Performance regression | Medium | Low | Performance budgets, automated testing, gradual rollout |
| Increased complexity | Medium | Medium | Thorough documentation, developer training, code reviews |
| Timeline delays | Medium | Medium | Buffer time in schedule, prioritize critical features |

## Success Metrics

- **Security**: No direct access to internal services from client
- **Performance**: 10% improvement in Core Web Vitals
- **Developer Experience**: Reduced time to implement new features
- **Code Quality**: 90%+ test coverage for critical paths
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Resource Requirements

- 1 DevOps Engineer (part-time)
- 1 UX Designer (part-time)
- 1 QA Engineer (part-time)

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Start | End |
|-------|----------|-------|-----|
| 1: Architecture Standardization | 4 weeks | Week 1 | Week 4 |
| 2: Component Library Development | 6 weeks | Week 5 | Week 10 |

| 4: Testing Enhancement | 4 weeks | Week 14 | Week 17 |
| 5: Accessibility Improvements | 3 weeks | Week 18 | Week 20 |

**Total Duration**: 20 weeks

## Rollback Plan

For each phase:

1. Document current state before changes
2. Implement changes in staging environment first
3. Maintain backward compatibility where possible
4. Create feature flags for new functionality
5. Have specific rollback procedures for each component

## Conclusion

This migration plan addresses the technical debt in our frontend applications while improving security, maintainability, and developer experience. By following a phased approach, we can minimize disruption while steadily improving our frontend architecture.

The end result will be a more secure, performant, and maintainable frontend ecosystem that enables faster development and better user experiences.
