# AI API Service Specification
## Overview
This document outlines the functional requirements and architecture for an internal AI API service built with Deno. The service will provide a unified interface for multiple applications to interact with various AI providers without needing to manage provider-specific details like API keys or implementation differences.
## Goals
- Create a centralized AI service that abstracts away provider-specific details- Provide both SDK and HTTP interfaces for integration
- Support synchronous text generation operations- Allow for future expansion to asynchronous operations and additional AI capabilities
## Target Users
- Internal development teams building applications that require AI capabilities- Services that need to integrate AI functionality without managing provider relationships
## Functional Requirements
### Core Functionality
1. **Text Generation**   - Accept text generation requests with messages in a conversation format
   - Support different AI models through a simple model name parameter   - Return generated text responses
   - Handle errors gracefully with meaningful error messages
### Integration Methods
1. **SDK Integration**
   - Provide a Deno-compatible SDK package for direct integration   - Support a simple client interface with a `generateText()` method
   - Allow configuration of connection details (base URL)
2. **HTTP API**   - Expose RESTful endpoints for AI operations
   - Accept JSON payloads for requests   - Return JSON responses
   - Implement proper error handling and status codes
### Configuration
1. **Provider Management**
   - Store and manage API keys for different providers   - Support environment variable configuration
   - Allow for easy addition of new providers
2. **Model Mapping**   - Map friendly model names to provider-specific model identifiers
   - Support default models when specific ones aren't requested
## Technical Architecture
### Components
1. **Core AI Service**
   - Abstracts provider-specific implementations   - Manages connections to AI providers
   - Handles model mapping and request formatting
2. **HTTP Server**   - Exposes REST endpoints
   - Handles request validation   - Manages response formatting
3. **SDK Client**
   - Provides a simple interface for application integration   - Handles communication with the HTTP server
   - Formats requests and responses
4. **Type Definitions**   - Define shared types for messages, requests, and responses
   - Ensure consistency across components
### Data Flow
1. Client applications interact with the AI service through either:
   - Direct SDK integration   - HTTP API calls
2. The service processes requests by:
   - Validating input   - Mapping to the appropriate provider and model
   - Sending the request to the AI provider   - Processing the response
   - Returning formatted results
## Future Expansion
### Planned Features
1. **Asynchronous Processing**
   - Support for long-running AI tasks   - Job queue management
   - Status checking and webhook callbacks
2. **Additional AI Capabilities**   - Image generation
   - Audio transcription   - Embeddings generation
3. **Advanced Features**
   - Request caching   - Rate limiting
   - Usage tracking and analytics
## Implementation Considerations
### Technology Stack- **Runtime**: Deno
- **AI Integration**: npm:ai package (version 4.3.16 or later)-
- **HTTP Server**: Preferably Deno build in server, Oak or similar Deno-compatible framework if not possible
### Performance Considerations
- Connection pooling for provider APIs- Potential for request batching
- Monitoring for response times and error rates
## Deployment- Containerized deployment
- Environment variable configuration- Health check endpoints
- Logging for debugging and monitoring
## Development Process- Test-driven development approach
- Modular architecture for maintainability
- Documentation for SDK usage and HTTP endpoints
- Version control with semantic versioning
